1.)What is class and objects and how are these related to one another?
2.) Ideal class, under what access specifier one should ideally write the methods and variables?
3.) Collections and how to implement HashMap, what is Linked Hash Map?
4.) Static and dynamic binding difference. 
5.) Method overloading and overriding difference.
6.) Constructors, are they mandatory? Need for default constructor.
7.) Primary key and foreign key.
8.) What is table.
9.) Full form of WORM in context to Java. 
10.) How is Java platform independent and how is it beneficial to users?
